# What is humans.txt and how have you configure it to your site?

Short description on humans.txt:

* It is a txt file that contains info about the different people who have contributed to build the website
* the only aim of this initiative is to know who the authors of the site we visit are

It is not complicated so why not give the the deservin ones their decrementions?
You can mention whoever you want, if of course you have their approval. There is not a standard way to create the humans.txt file yet, however it is common to devide the file in three sections (team, thanks and site). You can mention the developer, the designer, the copywriter, the webmaster, the CEO... it can be an endless road, particularly when your team not only consists of only you. 


If you decide to create a humans.txt file you should follow the structure of and place it in the site root, just next to the robots.txt
```
/*TEAM*/
/*THANKS*/
/*SITE*/
```

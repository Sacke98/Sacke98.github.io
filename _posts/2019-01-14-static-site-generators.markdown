# What do you think of static site generators?

When I got introduced to static site generators all I could think was "where is everything????" so at first I was very scared because the setup was new. However when you get comfortable you get used to example writing in your markdown sa casual as when you wrote in word in elementry school. I think a reason also why it got a bit scary to comprehend everything in the beginning is because alot had been made in advance, so it took some time to understand what everything was.

### What type of projects are they suitable for?

Using a static site generator is an advantage when you often add changes, or work in teams. It is also more suitable when you enjoy organizing your code in separate files.

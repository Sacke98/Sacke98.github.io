# What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

A CSS Preprocessor is used to extend and transform the CSS-language with some usable tools/parts.
Using CSS-preprocessors should contribute to some advantages such as less CSS to maintain, less repetition, calculations, better organized code by nesting, using variables, mixins and separate files. 

I liked the feature of better organized code and creating variables. It has become natural to want to separate your code in more files and nesting feels much more reasonable than the way ordinary CSS usually gets used.

The biggest "disadvantage" I have come across is the fact that this is the first time using a CSS-preprocessor (Sass). It took me some time to get to know the different tools and the setup. Then when you read about the disadvantages of CSS-preprocessors you read about that it is harder to debug your code, line numbers in the browser do not aline with the line numbers in source.
